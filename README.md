# Hi 👋, I’m Diego!

- Used to be a .NET FullStack developer (before NetCore and yes! I do use it as well) and actually backend developer with a pinch of frontend troublesolver that also designs your API's database.

## 🔭 Lately (or possibly currently)  at

- [API / DataBase / Data models] design (on SQL Server and MySQL).
- Small and medium size applications development focused on solving small business owners needs.
- Reduce your working time making executable pieces of code that may speed up repetitive and tedious time-consuming tasks at any area (science, accounting, etc.)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Flutter w/ BLoC.
- Firebase Cloud Firestore


## 💞️ I’ve collaborated (and looking forward) on projects based on:
- Some NetCore, Blazor, websites.
- A PHP front and backend role website.
- Database design/maintenance: MySQL, SQL Server Databases, Oracle on some projects

## 🥅 2024 coding goal:
- Work on flutter projects and upload here those who I've already have done (despite they are all incomplete since I'm learning it).

## 📫 You can reach me by email, I'll be happy to collaborate with you:
