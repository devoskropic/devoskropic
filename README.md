# Hi 👋, I’m Diego!

- Used to be a .NET FullStack developer (before NetCore and yes! I do use it as well) and lately interested/focused on backend developing with a pinch of frontend and desing of databases/API's (I also have interest on working as flutter developer or data analist).

## 🔭 Lately (or possibly currently)  at

- [API / DataBase / Data models] design (on SQL Server and MySQL).
- Small and medium size applications development focused on solving small business owners needs.
- Reduce your working time making executable pieces of code that may speed up repetitive and tedious time-consuming tasks at any area (science, accounting, etc.)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Currently enrolled as **Student** at Universidad Tecnológica de Durango at **Software Development and Managment career** 
- Flutter / BLoC pattern.
- Firebase Cloud Firestore

## 💞️ I’ve collaborated (and looking forward) on projects based on:
- Some NetCore, Blazor, websites.
- A PHP (front|back-end role) website.
- Database design/maintenance: MySQL, SQL Server Databases, Oracle on some projects
- Leading a small team of .net developers.
- As a .net support engineer in a worldwide team at IBM.

## 🥅 2024 coding goals:
- Work on flutter projects and upload here those who I've already have done (despite they are all incomplete since I'm learning it).
- **Get a Job as a Junior flutter developer, since I have experience coding, I can offer you the advantage to learn and integrate faster to the development team since I know how to work on a agile/scrum oriented teams.**
